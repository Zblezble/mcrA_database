## 🧫 Description

This database contains curated DNA mcrA and mrtA sequences sourced from the NCBI database using RESCRIPt followed up by a manual review.
The goal is to provide a high-quality, reusable dataset for the community. Only sequences featuring species annotations are present.

Featururing:
- LRD features 478 unique sequences with median length of 425 bp encompassing 188 different methanogen species 
- SRD features 411 unique sequences with median length of 211 bp encompassing 182 different methanogen species
